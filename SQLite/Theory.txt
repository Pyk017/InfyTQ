SQLite

What is SQLite?
SQLite is a software in which we write SQL queries. 
It is a light weight, no network access and embedded relational database type of software in which we execute sql.

Why?
My SQL, Oracle and Postgres, these are client-server DBMS. where SQLiter is a stand alone DBMS.
Today is the era of Internet of Things, everywhere internet is enabled in everything, ex. Fans, AC, watches, TV.
So, If a small amount of data is stored in a dbms, for this small data we can not have a mass database installed in system, like Oracle, MySQL
Thus this data is being executed and used using SQLite DBMS, which is light weight.

Where?
It is used anywhere like building a website, but the problem is the website is getting thousands of data then it require huge traffice over
network then it is not useful.
If we are building a software for AC, Fridge, we can use SQLite there.

SQLite is extremely useful when you need some database functionality and dont want to use a full-fledged database like my SQL and Postgres, 
so we can use sqlite for small to medium sized applications where your database is just gonna live on disk or you can use it for testing and
prototyping of an application .

SQLite is a part of standard library so there's no need to exteranlly install anything.

Data types :
1. NULL : The value is a Null value.
2. INTEGER : The value is a signed Integer, stored in 1, 2, 3, 4, 6,  or 8 bytes depending on the magnitude of the value.
3. REAL : The value is a floating point value, stored as an 8-byte IEEE floating point number.
4. TEXt : The value is a text string, stored using the database encoding(UTF-8, UTF-16BE OR UTF-16LE).
5. BLOB : The value is a blob of data, stored exactly as it was input.
