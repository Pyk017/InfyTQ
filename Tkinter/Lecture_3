					Creating Buttons with Tkinter
					
Everything in tkinter is a widget.
to create a button 

myButton = Button(root, text="Click ME") # Initiation
myButton.pack() # putting it on the window.

one more argument in Button() is STATE
myButton = Button(root, text="Click ME", state=DISABLED) # to create a non-clickable button

one more argument is PADX, PADY
myButton = Button(root, text="Click ME", padx=10, pady=20)

now we want our button to do something. we create a normal function.

def myClick():
	myLabel = Label(root, text="Look! I clicked a Button.").pack()
	
to call this function. 
one more argument is used that is COMMAND

myButton = Button(root, text="Click ME", command=myClick)

To change the color of the button.
FG use to change to the color of foreground color of the button.
BG to change the color of the background.
