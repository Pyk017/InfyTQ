To import Tkinter module 
we need to import the tkinter class
example : from tkinter import * 		to import every module present to tkinter class

then create a object 
say, root = tk()

And, to create anything in tkinter, it is a two step process.
1. initially create that thing or define a thing
2. and then put it on the screen

let create a label widget.
myLabel = Label(root, text='Hello World!')  # creating done 

# now to put it in the window.
myLabel.pack()		# packing method (many more mthods are present)

In Gui , we have a program running that is constantly looping that is how it figures out what is actually
happening in the application.

root.mainloop()		# this is the loop or we call main loop of the application.
