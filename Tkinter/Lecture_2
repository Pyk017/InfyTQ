For using grid system.
myLabel.grid(row=0, column=0)  # using .grid() method with position at row0, column0.

cannot be resized as it did before.
Changes are relative.


can also be written like 
mylabel = Label(root, text="hello").grid(row=0, column=1)
mylabel2 = Label(root, text='World!').grid(row=1, column=0)
