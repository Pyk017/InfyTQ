"""
In Hackerland every character has a weight. The weight of an English uppercase alphabet A-Z is given below :
A = 1
B = 2*A + A
C = 3*B + B
D = 4*C + C
â€¦.
Z = 26*Y + Y

The weight made up of these characters is the summation of weights of each character. Given a total string weight,
determine shortest string of given weight. If there is more than one solution, return the lexicographically smallest of
them. For example, given weight = 25, and the weights of the first few characters of the alphabets are A=1, B=3, C=12,
D=60 it is certain that no letter larger than C is required. Some of the strings with a total weight equal to the target
are ABBBBC, ACC, AAAAAAABBBBBB. The shortest of these is ACC. While any permutation of these characters will have same
, this is the lexicographically smallest of them.

Example
Input
20

Output
AABBC
